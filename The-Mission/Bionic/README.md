# Bionic

## The briefing

```
Thank you for taking on The Mission. You can begin by exploring the CONSTELLATIONS public website, constellations.page.

CONSTELLATIONS has "tried" to reduce their attack surface by offering just a static website. But you might find some low-hanging fruit to get you started.

You should find the flag for this challenge ON THIS constellations.page website.

With the flag of this challenge, you should also find a new URL that will assist in the next challenge.

After solving this challenge, you may need to refresh the page to see the newly unlocked challenges.
```

## The research

After navigating to [consteallations.page](https://constellations.page/) (might be a dead link). And we are greeted by this webpage:</br>
